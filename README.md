# Transfer

This example is to show how to use Twist to implement transfer money transaction.

## Usage

Install NPM modules via command in the following:

```shell
npm install
```

Then start service via npm command:

```shell
npm run server
```

## Demo

There is a client to create a transaction to transfer money from `fred` to `armani` wallet.

```shell
npm run client
```

There is faster way to execute client script:

 ```shell
 node ./client/client.js
 ```
